Sharing scientific data accelerates biomedical research discovery by enabling validation of research results, providing accessibility to high-value datasets, and promoting data reuse for future research studies. 

<SiteAlert title="BDC as a data repository" variant="info">
  Note: This page provides information about using BDC as a data repository, which means making data available to individuals who have eRA Commons credentials and who request and receive approved data access requests (DARs) through the [Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/). This is different from research teams collaborating on the analyses of BDC-hosted and/or Bring Your Own Data, which is described on the [Analyze Data webpage](/use-bdc/analyze-data).

## Instructions and Support for Sharing Data in BDC

NHLBI provides instructions and support to researchers preparing and submitting data to BDC:

- [Instructions for Preparing Clinical Research Datasets](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/guidelines-for-preparing-clinical-study-data-sets-for-submission-to-the-nhlbi-data-repository)
- [Instructions for Data Submission to BDC](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/data-management/data-submission-instructions)
- [Data Submission FAQs](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/data-management/data-submission-instructions/data-submission-faqs)

Researchers with BDC data-sharing-related inquiries should go to the [Contact Us webpage](/help-and-support/contact-us) and select the "Data Submission" type (dropdown option).

## NIH and NHLBI Data Management and Sharing Policies

NIH &mdash; including its institutes, centers, and offices &mdash; has data-sharing policies that researchers must abide by, including the NIH [Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy (effective January 25, 2023)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after), which provides information about [selecting a data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).
